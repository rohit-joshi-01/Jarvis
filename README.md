# 🟣 Smart AI Blob with Memory

A **fun, interactive AI assistant** in the form of a colorful floating blob! 🟣 This web-based AI assistant listens to your voice commands, answers questions, performs math calculations, fetches Wikipedia summaries, and even remembers past conversations in your browser.  

Built using **HTML and CSS**, this project combines animation, voice recognition, and local storage to create an engaging AI experience.

## 🖥 Demo

The blob floats around and listens to your queries. After you speak:  

1. It calculates math if your query is numeric.  
2. Otherwise, it fetches a Wikipedia summary.  
3. It speaks the answer aloud and stores it in local memory.  

**Visuals**: Eyes track your cursor and the mouth animates while speaking.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. Voice Recognition: Uses the browser’s SpeechRecognition API.
2. Text-to-Speech: Uses the browser’s SpeechSynthesis API to speak answers.
3. Math Evaluation: Parses and calculates arithmetic expressions in natural language.
4. Wikipedia API: Fetches short summaries for general knowledge questions.
5. Local Storage: Saves Q&A pairs to allow review of conversation history.
